## Setup: Ollama Configuration

Daniel asked to configure Ollama for use with OpenClaw.

**Status:**
- Ollama installed (version 0.16.2)
- Models requested: glm-5, kimi-k2.5, minimax-m2.5
- Download attempts made - very slow speeds (~180 KB/s for llama3.2)
- Models in library but experiencing "file does not exist" errors when pulling

**Next Steps:**
- Investigate why ollama pull is failing (possible network issue or API rate limit)
- Configure OpenClaw to use Ollama models once successfully downloaded
- Update openclaw.json to add ollama auth profile and model aliases
