## Added Solana (SOL) to Portfolio

### Request
User wanted to add Solana investment to the portfolio.

### Changes Made
1. Updated `monitor.js` to fetch SOL prices from Bitso (`sol_mxn`)
2. Added SOL to supported assets list
3. Updated `allocations.json` with new targets:
   - BTC: 40% (reduced from 50%)
   - ETH: 25% (reduced from 30%)
   - SOL: 15% (new)
   - USDC: 20% (unchanged)
4. Updated `portfolio_test.json` with 0.308 SOL
5. Tested system - SOL fetching works correctly

## Portfolio Clean Reset

### Request
User wanted to maintain original ~$3,000 MXN amount and clean all logs for perfect analysis.

### Changes Made
1. Redistributed portfolio to maintain ~$3,000 MXN:
   - BTC: 0.001014 (~$1,200 MXN, 40%)
   - ETH: 0.0213 (~$750 MXN, 25%)
   - SOL: 0.308 (~$450 MXN, 15%)
   - USDC: 34.9 (~$600 MXN, 20%)
   - Total: $3,003.21 MXN

2. Cleaned all old logs:
   - Deleted `logs/portfolio_2026-02-13.json` (old inconsistent data)
   - Deleted all price CSVs from 2026-02-13
   - Deleted initial 2026-02-14 logs

3. Created fresh clean baseline:
   - Single portfolio log entry with 4 assets
   - Clean price CSVs for BTC, ETH, SOL, USDC
   - Updated `last_test_run.txt` to reflect current timestamp

- ETH: 25.01% (target: 25%) ✅
- SOL: 15.01% (target: 15%) ✅
- USDC: 19.97% (target: 20%) ✅

**Rebalance status:** No rebalance needed (all within 0.03% of targets)

cd /home/dc/.openclaw/workspace/crypto-tracker && node analyze_performance.js 30

# Manual run
cd /home/dc/.openclaw/workspace/crypto-tracker && PORTFOLIO_MODE=test node monitor.js

```

## Notes

- System is working correctly with Bitso public APIs
- No API keys configured yet (portfolio is simulated)
- All logs are now clean and consistent
- Ready for accurate performance analysis from this baseline
- SOL price is fetched from Bitso's `sol_mxn` ticker (~$1,463 MXN)
